# RTOS Beginner Course

Welcome to the **RTOS Beginner Course** — a strategic, step-by-step course for embedded systems engineers to understand real-time operating systems (RTOS) from the ground up.  

This course is designed for **beginners**, but with **engineering depth**, exercises, and explanations.

## Course Goals

By the end of this course, you will:

- Understand microcontroller architecture  
- Understand bare-metal limitations  
- Learn key real-time concepts: deadlines, latency, jitter  
- Understand the need for RTOS  
- Prepare for practical RTOS exercises

## Course Structure

- **Module 1 — Embedded Systems Refresher**  
  Understand microcontrollers, bare-metal programming, super loop architecture, and interrupts.

- **Module 2 — Real-Time Systems Theory**  
  Learn hard vs soft real-time systems, deadlines, latency, jitter, and why RTOS is needed.

- **Module 3 — Tasks & Scheduler** *(coming soon)*  
  Learn multitasking, priorities, and scheduling in RTOS.

- **Module 4 — Inter-Task Communication** *(coming soon)*

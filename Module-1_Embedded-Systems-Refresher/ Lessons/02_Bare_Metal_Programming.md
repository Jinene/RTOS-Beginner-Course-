# Lesson 2 — Bare-Metal Programming

**Definition:** Running code directly on hardware **without an OS**.  

**Advantages:**

- Full control over hardware  
- Fast execution  
- Low memory usage  

**Limitations:**

- No task management  
- Hard to scale  
- Timing complexity  

**Conclusion:** Bare-metal is simple but unsuitable for complex real-time systems.


Don’t use heavy calculations

✅ Outcome: Understand how interrupts improve responsiveness but are limited in scope
